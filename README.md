# Dice_game

Here is a simple and interesting game built with javascript
though I found out the game is called Pig Game.
I was having little problem with DOM manipulation so I had to take this course to build this gameðŸ˜œ

Set it up on a static server
```sh
git clone https://github.com/SlyCreator/Dice_game
cd Dice_game
yarn
npx http-server -p 8000
```
